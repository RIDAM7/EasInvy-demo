# EasInvy

**EasInvy** is a lightweight inventory and billing system built for small shops that need
a simple, fast, and reliable way to manage stock, vehicles, and sales — without complex software.

This project started as a real-world solution for auto-parts and repair shops that still
rely on notebooks or spreadsheets.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

Most small businesses don’t need complicated ERP systems.
They need something that:

- Works on any device

- Can be customized quickly

EasInvy is built with that philosophy.
